Explore, visualize, and analyze the intersection of well and seismic data with **geoROCK**.

Developed by geoscientists, for geoscientists, **geoROCK** is a modern, user-friendly, and intuitive software package that delivers better and faster insights about the subsurface.

Identify prospective areas through an integrated analysis of geological, petrophysical, and seismic data interpretation.

Apply robust rock physics and synthetic modelling workflows and get a more complete picture of the area of interest.

Generate seismic synthetic models and crossplot data from well logs in a highly interactive manner to iteratively improve the lithology interpretation and information both at the well and in the seismic volume.

These workflows can be run quickly and iteratively to converge on optimum solutions that honor the underlying data and inform the user about the intrinsic rock relationships to ultimately enable critical decisions. These learnings, integrated across domains, deliver detailed lithology volumes that further enhance the reservoir rock properties model and understanding.

**geoROCK** works as a standalone application, and can connect directly into existing geoSCOUT and SeisWare applications.
